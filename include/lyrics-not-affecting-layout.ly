% 
% This snippet gets rid of uglinesses in note spacing caused by lyrics.
% By default, LilyPond always puts a lyric word exactly centered under
% the note it attaches to. When there is a long lyric word, LilyPond reserves
% space between notes so that there will be no collisions in the lyrics.
% However, this can lead to uneven note spacing. This snippet completely
% removes the presence of lyrics in note spacing so that it is natural
% according to the note lengths, and uses a spacing algorithm that shifts
% lyrics automatically in order to avoid collisions.
% 
% Some technical comments follow.
% 
% The spacing problem is set up as a quadratic optimization problem. Each
% lyric word has a strength value (by default, all words have a strength
% of 1.0). The demerit associated to a lyric word is s(x-p)Â², where s
% is the strength, x is the X coordinate and p is the ideal X coordinate
% where the lyric word would be centered on its associated note. An
% acceptable solution is a solution where no lyric words collide. The
% weight of a solution is the sum of the demerits for each of the words.
% Solving the lyric spacing problem means finding an acceptable solution
% of minimal weight.
% 
% In practice, words should not touch each other, but maintain a minimum
% distance between each other (controlled by LyricSpace.minimum-distance
% and LyricHyphen.minimum-distance). This is reduced to the form above
% by widening one of the two words for each LyricSpace or LyricHyphen
% grob, by the amount given by the minimum-space property.
% 
% The algorithm to solve the lyric spacing problem uses dynamic programming
% and runs in linear time. We add words one by one from left to right. After
% adding each word, the problem given by the words added so far is solved.
% The base case (zero words) is trivial. To add a word, it is very intuitive,
% and not hard to prove, that the following technique works: if adding
% the word at its optimal position produces no collision, then keep it
% there; else, make this word 'push' on its left neighbor and move these
% two words simultaneously to the left until the optimal position for
% these two words together is reached; if this still produces a collision
% then add the third word and consider the three words stuck together, etc.
% Note that once two words have been stuck together, they won't need
% to be taken apart again: they will be adjacent ("stuck") in the final
% configuration.
% 
% Written in this form, this algorithm looks quadratic. While probably
% acceptable in usual scores, this might become a problem with ly:one-line-breaking.
% However, with a bit of simple algebra, you can see that optimizing for two
% words stuck together (and, by extension, any finite number of words stuck
% together) is equivalent to optimizing for one single (imaginary) combined
% word, of which the length is the sum of the two lengths, the strength is
% the sum of the strengths, and the optimal coordinate is given by a simple
% formula (see the code). Therefore, instead of simultaneously considering
% two words stuck together, you can replace them with just one fresh problem
% variable. At each word added during the algorithm, there is a constant processing
% overhead, plus an overhead linear in the number of times a word is newly
% stuck to a group, forming a new group. If you imagine that all words start
% out black, and every word becomes white as soon as its group is stuck to
% the group on the left, it is clear that the total number of "add to group"
% operations is linear in the number of words. At the end, there is a
% step to compute the offset of each word from that of its group, which
% is made linear by caching the offset of a group as soon as it is
% visited. In this way, the total number of operations is linear.
